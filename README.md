**Welcome to NFC Infiltrator!** This is an intentionally vulnerable Android app, crafted for cybersecurity enthusiasts or anyone curious about NFC (Near Field Communication) intents vulnerabilities.

The NFC Infiltrator CTF is focused on helping you understand, discover, and exploit common NFC security vulnerabilities in Android apps through practical, hands-on experience.

---

## 📱 About the App:

**NFC Infiltrator** simulates a secure facility entry system that relies on Android's built-in NFC capabilities. Participants are challenged to explore and exploit intentionally embedded security flaws, including URI validation issues, improper authorization checks, MIME-type handling, and more.

---

## 🛠️ What You'll Need:

- A physical Android device (with NFC enabled)
- NFC tags

---

## 🚩 Challenges Overview:

The repository provides source code for challenges designed to showcase different NFC-based vulnerabilities:

- **Challenge 1:** Secured Facility *(Vulnerability: URI Scheme Injection)*
- **Challenge 2:** Enhanced Security Protocol *(Vulnerability: MIME Type Injection)*

Each challenge is thoughtfully designed to reflect realistic coding oversights and vulnerabilities encountered in actual Android applications using NFC technology.

## Challenge Solutions & Guide
